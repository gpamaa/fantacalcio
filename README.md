# Program for winning fantacalcio

this project was realized to give me the opportunity of organizing myself better during the auction. I was able to evaluate the player and in case I consider him worth, do an offer.
The program calculate for you the numbers of the player that you have and the other that remains so you can understand if the player is worth or not.
It divide the players into 3 categories: red that are good player for fantacalcio, yellow that are strong and green that are ok but it's a betting buying them.
To use it you have to download and execute the file main.java.
